    <h2> This paper will be about Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep and one key thing that is prevelant to the story; manipulation and the effects
    of it on everyone involved, not just the victim. Here is an image of the three characters of the game who are directly affected by Xehanort. </h2>

  <br> These characters are named Terra, Aqua, and Ventus respectively. As stated earlier, they are directly affected by Xehanort's manipulation, and
  met unfortunate fates in their debut game. </br>
